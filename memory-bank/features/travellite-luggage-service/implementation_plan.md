## Testing Strategy (TDD Approach)

Each phase will follow the Test-Driven Development cycle:
1. **Write failing tests** for the functionality
2. **Write minimal code** to make tests pass
3. **Refactor** code while keeping tests green
4. **Integration testing** after each phase completion

## Risk Mitigation
- **SMS/Email delivery**: Implement fallback mechanisms
- **Image upload failures**: Add retry logic and validation
- **Database performance**: Implement indexing and caching
- **Security**: Regular security audits and updates

## Success Metrics per Phase
- All tests passing
- Feature functionality working as specified
- Performance benchmarks met
- User acceptance criteria fulfilled

## Next Steps
1. Get user approval for requirements and implementation plan
2. Begin Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Infrastructure
3. Implement one phase at a time with user feedback
4. Regular progress updates and plan adjustments as needed
